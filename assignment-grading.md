# Daily Assignment Grades

Regarding assignments and grading: the list below lists the assignments that will be evaluated. 

In evaluting the assignments, we will look for following [roughly]: 

- +1 the code exists
- +2 the assignment is completed and the code works
- +1 the code is well commented or commits are meaningfully named

Bonus:

- +1 completed the the `bonus` section

#### Assignment 1 (pre-work)
- screenshot of codecademy lessons uploaded to the `assignments` repo in GitHub

#### Assignment 2 (commandline)
- `assignments` repository contains a few python files (like `aplusb.py`, `sayhello.py`) and some text files (like `wisecow.txt` or `wisething.txt`). This may differ per section.

#### Assignment 3 (git)
- `universe` repository contains all planets and is uploaded in several meaningful commits (not just one big one)

#### Assignment 4 (web/front-end-stack)
- section a: `simple-website` and `mozilla-website` repositories
- section b: only `simple-website` repository (that contains code from mozilla website part of the lesson)

#### Assignment 5 (web/visualization)
- `chart-example` repository

#### Assignment 6 (data)
(pair programming: I only expect these to be on one person's computer, but both names should be listed in the comments)
