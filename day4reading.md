# Readings for Day 4

## Assignment

The following readings are to help give you some additional context for David Zvenyach's guest lecture. Please read the background reading and then take your pick from the menu of options (or do your own research). 

Post a "burning question" that you may want to ask David in the #agile channel in slack, or respond to someone else's comment in a meaningful way that shows that you have engaged with the text and helps us to have a more nuanced conversation with David in the next class.
