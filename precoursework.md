# Pre-Course Work

1. Fill out the [pre-course survey](https://forms.gle/nTL6fZ14DntqpTy56). [~15 min]
2. Join the class [Slack](https://code4policy2020.slack.com/join/signup) chat. Introduce yourself in the `#section-a` or `#section-b` channel. Include a little bit about a policy area youâ€™re interested in so that everyone can be thinking about forming project groups with people who have similar interests. [~10 min]
3. Read Chapter 1 and 2 of "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland and JJ Sutherland, before the first day of class (a copy of chapters 1 & 2 will be provided) [~30 min]
4. Do the first "Interactive Lesson" for [Sections 1-5 & 8](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) of the Codecademy Python Tutorial. Please note that you only have to finish the first "interactive lesson" within each section. All the other sections, like quizzes/projects/etc, are **not** required. [Several Hours]
	- This assignment will be due on **Sunday January 12**, but I'm providing it ahead of time because it **will likely take several hours to complete** in addition to other assignments you will get during the class. Knowing programming **is not** a prerequisite for this course, but having experience with some of the basic concepts will help things move a little more smoothly. If you're new to code, it would be a good idea to start on these before the course begins to get a feel for things.
	- When you sign up for CodeCademy, you will get a 7-day free trial. You can either complete the lessons within that trial period or pay for a one-month membership.
	- Following these tutorials will be especially important if you haven't written code before. The goal is not mastery, but familiarity. These exercises will help you build the muscle memory of writing code (not misspelling commands, closing brackets you open, etc...) as well as some basic concepts (variables, lists, strings, logic). It will be easier to learn and use these concepts in class if you've encountered them before. If you get stuck, please feel free to ask questions in the `#python` channel in Slack. I will not be assuming prior knowledge for the class, so don't worry if its all new to you. The goal is to give you a sense of familiarity for when we work with code in the class.

## Course Materials


* Books
	* [Elements of Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O0U74Q/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by Chris Sims and Hillary Louise Johnson 
	* [SCRUM: A Breathtaking Brief and Agile Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction/dp/193796504X) by Chris Sims and Hillary Louise Johnson

	The kindle editions of these books are cheaper than paperback and can be read electronically on your browser through the [kindle cloud reader](https://read.amazon.com/) even if you don't own a kindle.
	
* Computer
	* You will need to bring a laptop to class.

## Additional Instructions for Windows Users

This course will require us to use a Unix shell, which is included in the Linux and Mac operating systems. A Unix shell, however, is not the default on Windows systems. Since it can be hard to debug many different computers with different configurations, I ask that Windows users install Ubuntu. There are a few different options for installing Ubuntu, please see the guide here: [windows.md](windows.md). 

If you're stuck, I've created a `#windows-users` channel in Slack where you can help one another get setup. Feel free to ping me (@Dhrumil Mehta) or Sultan (@Sultan Orazbayev) in the `#windows_users` channel and we will try our best to help out.
